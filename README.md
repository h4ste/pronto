## Data format
The `pronto` script load chronology and vocabulary files. Chronology and vocabulary files are assumed to follow specific formats.

### Chronology format
The format of this chronology file is assumed to be as follows:

    [external_patient_id]:[external_visit_id]\t[chronology]

where each ``[chronology]`` is encoded as as sequence of snapshots, separated by tabs:

    [[snapshot]\t...]

and each ``[snapshot]`` is encoded as:

    [delta] [label] [observation IDs..]

Note that snapshots are delimited by *spaces*, label must be 'true' or 'false', delta is represented in seconds
since previous chronology, and observation IDs should be the IDs associated with the observation in the given
vocabulary file.

For example, the line:

    11100004:1108a   0 false 1104 1105 2300 25001    86400 false 1104 2300   172800 true 1104 2300 3500

would indicate that patient with external ID '11100004' and visit with external ID '1108a' had a chronology including 3 snapshots
where:

* the first snapshot was negative for pneumonia, had a delta of 0, and contained only three clinical
  observations: those associated with vocabulary terms 1104, 1105, 2300, and 25001;
* the second snapshot was negative for pneumonia, had a delta of 86400 seconds (1 day), and included only
  two clinical observations: 1104 and 2300
* the third snapshot was positive for pneumonia, had a delta of 172800 seconds (2 days), and included only
  three clinical observations: 1104, 2300, and 3500
  
### Vocabulary format
The vocabulary file is assumed to be formatted as follows:

    [observation]\t[frequency]

where the line number indicates the ID of the observation in the chronology (e.g., 1104), ``[observation]`` is a
human-readable string describing the observation, and ``[frequency]`` is the frequency of that observation in
the dataset (this value is only important if specifying a max_vocabulary_size as terms will be sorted in
descending frequency before the cut-off is made)

Note: as described in the AMIA paper, chronologies are truncated to terminate at the first positive label.
Chronologies in which the first snapshot is positive or in which no snapshot is positive are discarded. 
The PRONTO scripts will automatically perform the truncation for you.
